# Premier Scoreboard

## What Does it Do?

Premier Scoreboard allows the user to track and display the scores at live sporting events. This can be useful when the scoreboard is not visible, or when the user is video-recording the event on one device, and wants to display the score in the video with another device.

## What Does it Use?

Premier Scoreboard is a cross-platform (iOS & Android) mobile app build with React Native. It uses React Context to store state, custom hooks, animated components, and local storage. It has a custom-built color-picker with over 300 colors that the user can choose from to represent their team colors.
